// Implementation notes for a real Gemini API:
/*
 * In a production implementation, you would:
 * 1. Send the image to Google's Gemini API with appropriate model prompting
 * 2. Parse the JSON response to extract soil classification
 * 3. Handle rate limiting, authentication, and error cases properly
 * 4. Consider caching results to avoid redundant API calls
